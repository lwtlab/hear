# AI Hear Free Version vs. Permanent Version

🎉 Hello, AI Hear is a practical **multilingual** speech-to-text transcription and real-time translation tool. Most features are free to use, including:

Speech-to-text transcription, real-time translation of original audio, material saving and exporting (original text, translations, .WAV audio files, .VTT subtitle files, etc.), switching or adding translation models, downloading and managing our pre-prepared speech transcription models for use in different languages, scenarios, and even offline environments (e.g., classrooms, lecture halls, subways, parks).

We offer an [Activate Permanent Version option (credit card or Alipay accepted)](https://checkout.thucydides.net/purchase/AIHear). After purchase, an AI Hear activation code will be sent to your specified email. Activation permanently removes the **15-minute automatic pause limitation**, enables smoother usage, and grants access to future premium features like meeting summaries, uploading local audio files for transcription and translation, etc.

Your support and assistance are the driving force behind our continued operation and upgrades.

### Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>🔸 Can AI Hear be used offline without internet?</summary>
All features remain available offline. However, real-time translation requires an additional local translation model. You can follow our guide to integrate different translation models. Using Ollama as an example, please refer to the <a href="https://hear.thucydides.net/zh-cn/reference/ollama">Local Translation Model Integration Guide</a>.

<details>
<summary>🔸 Are refunds available after successful purchase/payment?</summary>
Sorry, AI Hear permanent version purchases are non-refundable. Please evaluate carefully before purchasing. Reasons for no refunds:<br>
Digital product nature: Activation codes are considered delivered upon issuance and cannot be reclaimed. The permanent version provides lifetime activation.<br>
Transaction costs: Payment processors charge fees that we must bear after transaction completion, which aren't refunded even if you request a refund.<br>
Anti-abuse measures: We lack resources to handle occasional purchase-trial-refund abuse patterns.
