If you don't have an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, we don't recommend trying AI Hear. Local real-time speech-to-text requires significant computing power. Using CPU for transcription will result in slow response times and a poor user experience.

## GPU Support

Currently, both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards are supported.

AI Hear's underlying technology shares the same foundation as Ollama, so theoretically, any NVIDIA/AMD graphics card supported by Ollama should also work with AI Hear.

Click [Ollama supported graphics cards list](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md) to view the graphics cards supported by Ollama.

### NVIDIA Graphics Driver Requirements

To achieve optimal performance, we suggest using the newest graphics driver compatible with your Windows system.

Minimum Requirement: Your graphics driver's maximum supported CUDA version, as shown in the red box when running nvidia-smi.exe, must be 11.3 or higher.
