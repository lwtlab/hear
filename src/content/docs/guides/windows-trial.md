description: Try AI Hear on Windows

If you don't have an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card, we don't recommend trying AI Hear. Local real-time speech-to-text requires significant computing power. Using CPU for transcription will result in slow response times and a poor user experience.

## GPU Support

Currently, both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards are supported.

AI Hear's underlying technology shares the same foundation as Ollama, so theoretically, any NVIDIA/AMD graphics card supported by Ollama should also work with AI Hear.

Click [Ollama supported graphics cards list](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/gpu.md) to view the graphics cards supported by Ollama.
