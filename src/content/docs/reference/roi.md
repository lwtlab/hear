## **Scenario 1: The Triple Pain of Listening for International Students: Incomplete Listening, Incomplete Note-Taking, and Difficulty in Finding Information**

### **🎯 Typical User Profile**

- Overseas undergraduate/graduate students (bilingual environments such as Chinese-English, Chinese-German, Chinese-Japanese)
- 15 hours of lectures per week, involving a large number of technical terms
- Simultaneous use of computers, voice recorders, and note-taking software, with scattered materials and heavy review burden

### **💢 Core Pain Points → Wasted Investment**

| **Pain Category** | **Specific Manifestation** | **Hidden Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Language Barrier** | Listening to non-native language, unfamiliar with terms, and fast speech | Need to re-listen and repeatedly look up words, severely reducing efficiency |
| **Media Separation** | Course materials, audio, and terms are scattered across different devices/platforms | Fragmented knowledge, cumbersome review process |
| **Difficulty in Terminology Translation** | Accurate translation of professional terms such as chemical names and engineering abbreviations is difficult | Misunderstanding of core concepts, affecting exam and paper quality |
| **Inability to Review** | Forgetting what was heard and difficulty in finding key explanations | Time wasted on "where did he/she say that?" instead of actual learning |

📉 **Estimated Loss**: In 15 hours of weekly courses, about 30% of the time is wasted due to understanding deviations and material organization, = nearly 20 hours per month.

### **✅ AI Hear Investment → Immediate Return**

| **Function Module** | **Corresponding Pain** | **Return** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Precise Audio Source Recognition** (online system sound / offline microphone) | Language and audio reception issues | No missed words, no lost segments, complete acquisition of first-hand information |
| **Bilingual Subtitles + Terminology Recognition** | Translation difficulties | Real-time term recognition, reducing word lookup costs |
| **Automatic Packaging of Course Materials** (audio + text + timeline) | Media separation | One-click material organization, zero obstacles in review |

### **📊 ROI Numerical Estimation (Example of an International Student)**

| **Item** | **Without AI Hear** | **With AI Hear** | **Improvement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly review/organization time | 10 hours | 2 hours | ⬇️ Saves 8 hours |
| Term lookup time | 5 minutes × 20 times | 1 minute × 20 times | ⬇️ Saves 80% of time |
| Course material search error | Often losing paragraphs/missing recordings | Automatically structured archiving | ⬇️ Error rate drops by 90% |
| **Long-term Cost Comparison** | iFlytek voice recorder + transcription package (about $1,500-$3,000/year) | AI Hear $29.9 localization + one-time authorization | ⬇️ Cost reduction of over 60%, more academic scene-oriented |

## **Scenario 2: The "Incomplete Listening, Inaccurate Translation, and Inability to Transmit" in Cross-border Meetings**

### **Typical User Profile**

- Team members of multinational corporations/research institutions (mixed Chinese, English, Japanese)
- Participate in or organize 5-10 international meetings per week (using various platforms: Zoom, DingTalk, Teams, etc.)
- Involves sensitive terms, product information, or regulatory discussions, prohibiting audio uploads to third-party servers

### **💢 Core Pain Points → Double Anxiety of Communication and Security**

| **Pain Category** | **Manifestation** | **Hidden Cost** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Platform Limitations** | Different countries/organizations use different meeting tools, poor language/transcription compatibility | Interpreting tools require platform cooperation, complex switching process |
| **Inaccurate Translation** | Vague translation of product models and technical terms ("it", "new model") | Affects negotiation, decision-making, and record accuracy |
| **Data Privacy Anxiety** | Need to sign NDA in situations where the use of "cloud upload" AI services is prohibited | High risk of using SaaS transcription tools, significant data compliance pressure |
| **Multilingual Synchronization Difficulty** | In a meeting with Chinese, English, and Japanese participants, conventional subtitle tools can only display one language | Need to separately translate notes after the meeting, extremely low efficiency |

### **✅ AI Hear Investment → Triple Return**

| **Function Module** | **Corresponding Pain** | **Return** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Free Audio Capture (system sound priority)** | Diverse meeting tool platforms | No plugins, no platform authorization, instant transcription, universal platform compatibility |
| **Local Real-time Multilingual Translation** | Multilingual subtitle synchronization | Participants can privately display Chinese/English/Japanese subtitles on their screens, avoiding repeated confirmations |
| **Full Offline Operation + Local Storage** | Data privacy risk | Zero upload, meets NDA/intranet meeting security requirements |

### **📊 ROI Numerical Estimation (Example of a Sino-Japanese-American Tech Company)**

### **Table**Copy

| **Item** | **Conventional Solution (SaaS Transcription)** | **With AI Hear** | **ROI Improvement** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-platform compatibility | Need to adapt tools for Zoom/DingTalk/Teams separately | One-click system sound recognition, universal platform compatibility | ✅ Reduced technical maintenance costs |
| Translation term accuracy | General translation with term errors (70%) | Enterprise term library adaptation (accuracy increased to 90%) | ⬆️ Expression accuracy +20% |
| Data compliance | Involves uploading to overseas servers | Fully local execution, zero risk | ✅ Meets confidential meeting requirements |
| Multilingual real-time display | Shared subtitles in one language | Each person privately displays their mother tongue version | ⬆️ Multilingual communication efficiency increased by 50% |
| **Long-term Cost Comparison** | iFlytek Hearing/Tencent Interpretation Enterprise Edition (about ¥15,000+/year/account) | AI Hear $29.9/account (permanent use) | ⬇️ Cost reduction of 90%, no ongoing traffic fees |

## **Scenario 3: The "Feedback Anxiety" of Product Managers**

**Typical Role**: Erin, Product Manager

**Common Tasks**: User Interviews → Organizing Feedback → Forming New Features/User Stories → Jira Entry

❌ **Challenges Before Using AI Hear**

| **Problem Category** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ⏱️ Low Efficiency | Each interview organization requires manual listening to recordings and typing, taking **3 days per time** |
| 🌐 Fragmented Scenarios | Difficulty in unified collection and archiving of Tencent Meetings, face-to-face interviews, and voice app interviews |
| 🔐 Data Risk | Using cloud voice tools poses **user privacy leakage risks** |

Product managers need a cross-platform integrated tool that offers "unified recording + high-quality transcription + privacy protection."

1. Launch AI Hear (select system audio/microphone)
2. Automatic transcription (supports multiple languages, automatic timeline)
3. Export as TXT/SRT, upload to Jira to automatically generate user stories

✅ **Core Technical Advantages**

| **Function Module** | **User Value** |
| --- | --- |
| 🎧 Multi-audio source recording | Supports Zoom, Tencent Meetings, offline microphones, **covering all interview scenarios** |
